        <h2>Why build a monument of pixels?</h2>
        <p>
            In the physical world, monuments are built of granite and bronze. They are heavy, expensive, and reserved for kings or conquerors. But in the digital age, our lives are lived in the ether. Our memories are scattered across social media platforms that might not exist in twenty years.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Nna</em>, I realized that we are the first generation to leave behind a massive digital footprint, yet it’s the most fragile one in history. When a server goes dark, a life’s work can vanish. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>The Vault of Time</strong> was built to solve this. It is a decentralized, permanent "Memory Wall." By claiming a block, you aren't just buying pixels; you are anchoring your name, your brand, or your story into a digital timeline designed to outlive the noise of the day-to-day internet.

        <h2>A Message from The Keeper</h2>
        <p>
            I’m Nthabiseng, a self-taught coder from South Africa. I built this Vault from the ground up because I believe that "ordinary" people deserve to be remembered just as much as the icons. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Whether you use your block to shout out your business, commemorate a loved one, or simply leave a "I was here" for future digital archaeologists to find—you are helpng build a collective human mosaic.
        </p>
        <p>
            The grid is vast, but the space is finite. 1,000,000 blocks. No more, no less. Thank you for being part of the first chapter.
