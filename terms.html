  <h1>📜 Terms & Conditions</h1>

  <p>
    The Vault of Time (“we”, “our”, “us”) is a digital monument made of exactly 1,000,000 blocks.
    Each block is permanently recorded as part of this public archive.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Ownership & Rights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You retain full copyright of any content you upload.</li>
    <li>By submitting content, you grant us a permanent license to display, store, and preserve it as part of the Vault.</li>
    <li>This license is non-exclusive and grants you the right to maintain your legacy on the platform.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Edits & Permanence</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Block owners retain the right to edit their block’s message or media to ensure the accuracy of their archived content.</li>
    <li>The Vault is designed as a long-term archive — blocks are intended to exist indefinitely.</li>
    <li>While standard edits are permitted, excessive modifications may be flagged under our commercial policies (see below).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Commercial Use & Bulk Policy</h2>
  <p>While The Vault of Time allows owners to edit their block content to preserve the accuracy of their legacy, specific rules apply to <strong>Commercial</strong> and <strong>Bulk</strong> block owners:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Static Real Estate:</strong> Commercial blocks are sold as permanent, static digital real estate, similar to a physical plaque or monument. They are <strong>not</strong> intended for use as dynamic, rotating billboards.</li>
    <li><strong>Update Frequency:</strong> To preserve the integrity of the Vault, commercial content updates are limited. Using the "Edit" feature to promote rotating weekly specials, temporary sales, or fleeting events (e.g., updating content more than once every 30 days) is prohibited under the standard license.</li>
    <li><strong>Right to Lock:</strong> The Vault of Time reserves the right to permanently lock editing access or require a commercial subscription upgrade for any Bulk or Commercial blocks found to be using the platform for high-frequency dynamic advertising.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Pricing & Payment</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Each block is priced according to chapters. Chapter 1 blocks cost $6.</li>
    <li>Payment is processed securely via PayPal.</li>
    <li>All sales are final once the block is sealed.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Content Rules</h2>
  <p>Your uploaded content must NOT include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Hate speech or harassment</li>
    <li>Illegal content or threats of harm</li>
    <li>Copyrighted content you do not own</li>
    <li>Sexually explicit or violent material</li>
    <li>Personal data of other people without their consent</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We reserve the right to remove content that violates these rules without offering a refund.</p>

  <h2>6. Data & Privacy</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We only store your name, email, message, and upload.</li>
    <li>We will never sell your data or share it with advertisers.</li>
    <li>Payment information is handled externally by PayPal — we do not see or store card details.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Liability</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Users are responsible for the content they submit.</li>
    <li>We are not liable for legal issues arising from user-generated content.</li>
    <li>We reserve the right to remove content that violates laws or these terms.</li>
  </ul>
