  <h1>📜 Terms & Conditions</h1>

  <p>
    The Vault of Time is a permanent digital monument consisting of exactly 1,000,000 blocks. 
    By securing a block, you are securing a piece of internet history, <strong>fixed in time.</strong>
  </p>

  <h2>1. Ownership & Rights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You retain full copyright of any content you upload.</li>
    <li>By submitting content, you grant The Vault of Time a permanent, irrevocable license to display, store, and preserve your media as part of the public archive.</li>
    <li>This license ensures your legacy remains intact on the platform for as long as the Vault exists.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Edits & Permanence</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Block owners may edit their block’s message or media to maintain the accuracy of their archived legacy.</li>
    <li>The Vault is a long-term archive. While edits are permitted, they must align with the spirit of a permanent monument.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Commercial Use & Bulk Policy</h2>
  <p>The Vault of Time serves as digital real estate. Specific rules apply to <span class="gold-text">Commercial</span> and <span class="gold-text">Bulk</span> holdings:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Static Real Estate:</strong> Blocks are sold as static monuments. High-frequency advertising updates are prohibited.</li>
    <li><strong>Update Frequency:</strong> Content updates are restricted to once every 30 days unless a Commercial Tier license is negotiated.</li>
    <li><strong>Anchor Tenancy:</strong> The Vault reserves the right to lock editing access for blocks used for dynamic advertising that compromises the "Fixed in Time" aesthetic.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. The Chapter System & Dynamic Pricing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The Vault is released in ten (10) distinct Chapters of 100,000 blocks each.</li>
    <li><strong>Pricing Tiers:</strong> Earlier chapters are priced lower to seed the project. Pricing increases by $2 with each subsequent Chapter release.</li>
    <li><strong>Current Chapter 1 Price:</strong> $6 per block.</li>
    <li><strong>Planned Escalation:</strong> Chapter 2 is $8, Chapter 3 is $10, and so on, until a final retail price of $24 in Chapter 10.</li>
    <li>All sales are final once the block is sealed.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Content Rules</h2>
  <p>To keep the Vault elite, content must NOT include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Hate speech, harassment, or illegal threats.</li>
    <li>Copyrighted material you do not own.</li>
    <li>Sexually explicit or excessively violent material.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Data & Privacy</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We store your name, email, and legacy content. We do not sell data to third-party advertisers.</li>
    <li>Payment information is handled exclusively by PayPal.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Liability</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Users are solely responsible for the legal implications of the content they archive.</li>
    <li>The Vault of Time is not liable for intellectual property disputes arising from user-generated content.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. The Grand Finale: Block 1,000,000</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Auction Status:</strong> Block #1,000,000 is the "Crown Jewel" of the Vault and is <span class="gold-text">EXCLUDED</span> from all standard retail and bulk purchases.</li>
    <li><strong>No Buy-Outs:</strong> This final block cannot be acquired as part of a page or district buy-out.</li>
    <li><strong>Public Auction:</strong> Ownership of the final pixel will be determined via a public auction once the first 999,999 blocks have been secured. Anyone wishing to own the final piece of the Vault must enter the bidding process.</li>
  </ul>
