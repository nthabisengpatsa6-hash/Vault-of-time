  <h1>📜 Terms & Conditions</h1>

  <p>
    The Vault of Time is a permanent digital monument consisting of exactly 1,000,000 blocks. 
    By securing a block, you are securing a piece of internet history, <strong>fixed in time.</strong> 
    The Vault is owned and operated by <strong>Vault Of Time (Pty) Ltd</strong>, a registered company in the Republic of South Africa.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Ownership & Rights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You retain full copyright of any content you upload.</li>
    <li>By submitting content, you grant The Vault of Time a permanent, irrevocable, world-wide license to display, store, and preserve your media as part of the public archive.</li>
    <li>This license ensures your legacy remains intact on the platform for as long as the Vault exists.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Edits & Permanence</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Block owners may edit their block’s message or media using their secure <strong>Magic Link</strong> login.</li>
    <li>While edits are permitted, they must align with the spirit of a permanent monument. High-frequency "flipping" of content is discouraged to maintain the archive's aesthetic.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Commercial Use & Bulk Policy</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Static Real Estate:</strong> Blocks are sold as static monuments. Using blocks for high-frequency dynamic advertising that mimics a scrolling banner is prohibited.</li>
    <li><strong>Update Frequency:</strong> Content updates are restricted to once every 30 days unless a specialized Commercial Tier license is negotiated.</li>
    <li><strong>Anchor Tenancy:</strong> The Vault reserves the right to lock editing access for blocks used for dynamic advertising that compromises the "Fixed in Time" aesthetic.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. The Chapter System & Payments</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Sales are Final:</strong> Due to the digital and permanent nature of the Vault, all sales are final once a block is sealed. No refunds will be issued for "change of mind."</li>
    <li><strong>First-to-Pay Protocol:</strong> In the interest of fairness, bulk block quotes do not constitute a reservation. Blocks remain available to the public until a transaction is time-stamped and confirmed in our system.</li>
    <li><strong>Pricing Tiers:</strong> Prices escalate by $2 with each Chapter release (100,000 blocks). Current Chapter pricing is binding at the time of invoice.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Content Standards & Right of Seizure</h2>
  <p>To keep the Vault elite and respectful, we maintain a <strong>Zero-Tolerance Policy</strong>. Prohibited content includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Hate speech, harassment, or illegal threats.</li>
    <li>Prohibited political or hate-group symbols (e.g., swastikas).</li>
    <li>Sexually explicit, pornographic, or excessively violent material.</li>
    <li><strong>The Consequence:</strong> Violation of these standards will result in the <strong>immediate seizure</strong> of the associated blocks and a permanent ban of the user's email address.</li>
    <li><strong>No Refund for Violators:</strong> If content is removed due to a T&C violation, <span class="gold-text">NO REFUND</span> will be issued.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Data, Privacy & POPIA</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>POPIA Compliance:</strong> In accordance with the South African Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA), we only process the personal data necessary to manage your legacy (Name, Email, and Content).</li>
    <li><strong>Security:</strong> We use secure "Magic Links" for authentication. We do not store passwords, and we never sell your personal data to third-party advertisers.</li>
    <li><strong>Financials:</strong> All payments are processed via PayPal; the Vault never sees or stores your banking details.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Liability & Force Majeure</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The Vault of Time (Pty) Ltd is not liable for intellectual property disputes arising from user-generated content. Users assume all legal responsibility for the media they archive.</li>
    <li><strong>System Uptime:</strong> While we use industry-standard hosting (Firestore/Netlify), we are not liable for data loss or site downtime caused by third-party provider failures, "Acts of God," or cyber-attacks.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. The Grand Finale: Block 1,000,000</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Auction Status:</strong> Block #1,000,000 is the "Crown Jewel" and is <span class="gold-text">EXCLUDED</span> from all standard retail and bulk purchases.</li>
    <li><strong>No Buy-Outs:</strong> This final block cannot be acquired as part of a district buy-out. Ownership will be determined via a public auction once the first 999,999 blocks are secured.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>9. Jurisdiction</h2>
  <p>These terms are governed by the laws of the <strong>Republic of South Africa.</strong> Any legal disputes will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the South African courts.</p>
