      <h2>1. What The Vault Is</h2>
      <p>
        The Vault of Time is a digital monument to memory — a global archive where real people
        leave fragments of their lives behind. A reminder that you don’t need fame or a massive legacy
        to be remembered. Every block is a personal artefact. Every contributor becomes part of the timeline.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="legend-section">
      <h2>2. Why the Vault Opens in Chapters</h2>
      <p>
        Each chapter represents an era of collective memory. Chapter 1 marks the beginning — the Vault Keepers Era.
        Future chapters unlock only when the previous one is filled. This creates continuity, momentum,
        and a historical structure.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="legend-section">
      <h2>3. The Key Symbol</h2>
      <p>
        The Key represents access, guardianship, and the unlocking of preserved memory.
        It is the insignia of the Vault Keepers — the first citizens of the Vault.
      </p>

    <section class="legend-section">
      <h2>4. The Four Badges of Chapter 1</h2>

      <h3>Badge I — The First Gate (1–25 000)</h3>
      <p>Pioneer energy. The earliest believers who stepped into the Vault before the crowds.</p>

      <h3>Badge II — The Orbit Circle (25 001–50 000)</h3>
      <p>This era symbolises expansion. The Vault gaining gravity and drawing more people in.</p>

      <h3>Badge III — The Guardian Flame (50 001–75 000)</h3>
      <p>Growth and ignition. The Vault becomes undeniable — the flame intensifies.</p>

      <h3>Badge IV — The Diamond Sigil (75 001–100 000)</h3>
      <p>
        The finalize era of Chapter 1. The closers, the ones who sealed the first chapter of the Vault’s history.
      </p>

    <section class="legend-section">
      <h2>5. What It Means to Be a Vault Keeper</h2>
      <p>
        Vault Keepers are the founders — the original generation who built the foundation.
        They hold the Key symbol, marking them as custodians of the First Era.
      </p>

    <section class="legend-section">
      <h2>6. Why Blocks Are Limited</h2>
      <p>
        Scarcity gives meaning. Every block is finite, unique, and irreplaceable. A digital artefact preserved forever.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="legend-section">
      <h2>7. Why Images & Audio Matter</h2>
      <p>
        Humans remember life through moments — a picture, a voice note, a sound.
        The Vault stores memories the way our minds do.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="legend-section">
      <h2>8. After the 1,000,000th Block</h2>
      <p>
        Once the final chapter closes, the Vault becomes an immutable archive — a sealed digital time capsule.
        What happens after that is up to history.
