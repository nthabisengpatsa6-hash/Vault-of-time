      <h2>1. What the Vault Is</h2>
      <p>
        The Vault of Time is a digital monument to human memory — built not by celebrities or institutions,
        but by ordinary people. Every block is a footprint, a fragment, a message to the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not social media. It’s an archive. A testament. A global time capsule made of 1,000,000 individual stories.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="legend-section">
      <h2>2. Why the Vault Opens in Chapters</h2>
      <p>
        The Vault is divided into 10 chapters of 100,000 blocks each. Every chapter represents an era — 
        a moment in global memory shaped by the people who choose to leave something behind.
      </p>
      <p>
        A chapter opens only when the previous one is complete, creating a living timeline written in real time.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="legend-section">
      <h2>3. The Key Symbol</h2>
      <p>
        The Key represents guardianship, remembrance, and access to the Vault’s inner world.
        It honours the first generation of contributors — the Vault Keepers — who anchor the beginning of Chapter 1.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="legend-section">
      <h2>4. The Vault Keepers</h2>
      <p>
        The earliest participants of the Vault hold a special place in its history.
        They are the first generation — the ones who helped ignite a monument that will outlive all of us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every Keeper’s block becomes part of the foundation on which all future chapters will stand.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="legend-section">
      <h2>5. Why Blocks Are Limited</h2>
      <p>
        Scarcity creates meaning. With only 1,000,000 blocks that will ever exist, each one becomes a unique digital artefact —
        finite, irreplaceable, and permanently part of the Vault’s legacy.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="legend-section">
      <h2>6. Why Images & Audio Matter</h2>
      <p>
        Memory isn’t just text. It’s faces, colours, voices, sounds.  
        The Vault preserves human expression the way we naturally remember it — visually, emotionally, and sonically.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="legend-section">
      <h2>7. After the 1,000,000th Block</h2>
      <p>
        When the final chapter closes, the Vault transitions into a sealed digital time capsule.
        Its contents — millions of memories from around the world — become an archive for future generations to study,
        preserve, and wonder about.
